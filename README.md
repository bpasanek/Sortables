## About this Project

This puzzle poetry project aims to remediate Bob Cobbing's sound poem (shown below) as a React site. A word in the poem is a tile and when the main page is first loaded, the tiles will appear out of order. The puzzle requires the aspirant to sort the words into the correct order: the order in which they appear. Each draggable tile is both a sound and word. When clicked a sound file plays. When the words are put in the correct order--in effect, when the aspirant has composed Cobbing's poem--the whole poem will be read, from beginning to end.
